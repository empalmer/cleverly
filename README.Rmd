# cleverly

<!-- badges: start -->

Cleverly stands for (Cl)ustering with (E)xternal (V)ariabl(e)s in (R) with (L)ongitudinal (Y)s. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of cleverly from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("empalmer/cleverly")
library(cleverly)
```



```r
set.seed(127)
  sim <- sim_Z_longitudinal(n = 20,
                            range_start = 5000,

                        "Capture.Number",
                        "Z"))

                  epsilon_d = .05,
                  epsilon_b = .01,
                  epsilon_2 = .001,
                  cor_str = "IND")
  end <- Sys.time()
  (duration <- end - start)
  res$clusters$no
```


<!--
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cleverly)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
