# cleverly

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Cleverly stands for (Cl)ustering with (E)xternal (V)ariabl(e)s in (R) with (L)ongitudinal (Y)s. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of cleverly from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, echo = F}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("empalmer/cleverly")
library(cleverly)
```

## Example

Simulate data with independence structure, then run cleverly assuming an independence structure:

```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(127)
sim <- simulation_data(n = 20,
                       range_start = 5000,
                       range_end = 20000,
                       nknots = 3,
                       K = 12,
                       order = 3,
                       user_var = 1000,
                       cor_str = "IND")

Y <- dplyr::select(sim, -c(
  "total_n",
  "Capture.Number",
  "Z"))
Z <- sim$Z

true_cluster <- rep(1:3, each = 4)

res <- cleverly(Y = Y,
                Z = Z,
                subject_ids = individual,
                lp = 0,
                time = time,
                cor_str = "IND",
                theta = 300,
                parralel = F,
                psi_min = 10,
                psi_max = 1400,
                npsi = 3,
                gammas = c(1, 1)) %>%
  get_cluster_diagnostics(true_cluster)


```

# Diagnostics: 

Since we know the true clusters: 


```{r}
res$cluster_diagnostics
```

We selected the exact right clusters!

Visualize the data + clusters 

```{r}
plot_clusters(res,
              Z = rep(Z, 12),
              response_names = 1:12, 
              Z_type = "binary")
```

Look at BIC values for the different hyper parameter values tested: 

```{r}
plot_BIC(res, BIC_type = "BIC", psis = seq(600, 1400, length.out = 1))
```


<!--
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cleverly)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
