  B,

\arguments{
\item{l}{external variable index}

\item{mi_vec}{vector of the number of timepoints for each sample. Of length n}

\item{beta}{matrix of beta (or beta hat) of dimension (P*K) x L}

\item{Z}{Matrix that starts with a column of 1s. Of dimension M x (L + 1) that contains the external variable values for each subject/time and is 1 for l = 0. In the case that there are no external variables this is a matrix with one column of 1s.}

\item{B}{B spline basis matrix of dimension (N x P)}

\item{phi}{Current value of overdispersion parameter}

\item{C}{Constant for determining the hessian change.}

\item{V_inv}{(optional) List of V inverses for each i. If supplied is faster}

\item{K}{}
}
\value{
Matrix of dimension KP times KP
}
